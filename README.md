*"We the unwilling led by the unknowing are doing the impossible for the ungrateful. We have done so much for so long, with so little, we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."*

### About Me
I am self-taught, self-motivated, and always learning. I don't half-ass what I work on and don't take no for an answer. I can be hard to work with because my standards are high, but I pride myself in what I accomplish.


I am a systems architect / engineer by trade, with a focus on automation, integration and devops. I have a background in .Net, as well as various automation platforms like Powershell and Ansible.

I have a "home lab" with enough capacity to run most medium businesses, with redundancy that would put most of my employers to shame.

### What I'm Working On

I am working on several in-flight projects revolving around security and real-time messaging. Unfortunately these aren't yet publicly visible because I intend on monitizing them.
